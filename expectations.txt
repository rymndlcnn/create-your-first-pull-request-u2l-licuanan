I am Raymond Licuanan and here are some of my expectations to this course:
1. I expected this course to be work-intensive but will teach me a lot on web programming.
2. I expected our lab professor to be approachable for students' inquiries.
3. I expected me to become a more responsible student developer after this course.

EDIT: I agree with all of your expectations, I hope we learn a lot together this semester!
